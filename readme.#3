Date 18 Dec 06 
---------------
1. added External ADC AD974 code


TESTED


Date 14 Jan 2007
----------------
1. Made Modifications for spike analysis and filtering
2. tested spike issue with a filter count of 50 ; found ok.
4. Pending : Check with 20 Hz Sine Wave
5. Pending : Igniter and Section I showing same on Windows Software in some condition?
6. Appears as if A1 = always LOW ; ADC MUX Channel selector ?? 
   .. almost confirmed... This must be reason for Windows Software showing Same values
   .. no problem suspected with FE Software 
- Modifications done by Prem Chand

Date 16 Jan 2007
-----------------
1. The Data repeating in another channel could be because of SPIKE FILTER
2. Front End -40 +40 Graph Scale tobe relaxed to -48 +48 for test purposes
3. 

Date 17 Jan 2007
----------------
1. Tested for hanging symptoms, But no such symptons are found.
2. Diagnosis is postponed.
3. Please check the *** CAUTION : written in Flash_Tbt.c ***

Date 22 Jan 2007 : 00:15 AM
----------------------------
1. Observed that FlashWrite Routine is returning back without actually
writting to Flash, when SectorNumber is > 0x40. This Field is actually 
not used in the code, except during Erase Operation.
2. Bypassed the return statement, Check is ON. 
3. Problem : Data Fetch retrieves 0xFF for data bytes.
4. There are some Front End Issues. 
The Initial Graph Screen Displays scale in milliseconds on the axis.. 
But data plotting appears as if it is seconds...
5.
